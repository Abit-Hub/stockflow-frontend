## Netlify build settings for this Next.js app
## This tells Netlify to run pnpm build in the repository root and publish the
## generated `.next` folder. If your app lives in a subfolder, set `base` to
## that folder and update `publish` accordingly (e.g. "frontend/.next").

[build]
  command = "pnpm build"
  publish = ".next"

# Optional: set an edge function directory or other settings here if needed
# For monorepos: set `base = "path/to/frontend"` under [build]
